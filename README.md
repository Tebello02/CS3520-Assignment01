# CS3520-Assignment01
Above are the programs that print the first 10 reversible prime squares...First written in C,as a pseudo code for the following MIPS assembly code,and it works perfectly fine,giving out exactly first 10 reversible prime squares...
The following MIPS assembly code does not give out any errors...
The struggle of using stack memory for saving registers led to the program having No output..
As soon as  the concept of using stack memory for saving registers is understood,the code will definetely get fixed to get the correct expected output..
