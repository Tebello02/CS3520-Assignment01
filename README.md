# CS3520-Assignment01
Above are the programs that prints the first 10 reversible prime numbers...First written in C,which works perfectly fine..
And then after is the same program written with MIPS assembly language..
MIPS assembly code does not give out any errors..
The struggle of using stack memory for saving registers led to the program having No output..
As the concept of using stack memory for saving registers is understood,the code will definetely get fixed to get the correct expected output..
